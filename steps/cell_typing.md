<goal>
Identify cell types in each cluster.
</goal>

<method>
1. **Extract top 20 marker genes per cluster** (not just 5 - critical markers often appear in positions 6-20)

2. **Analyze and interpret each cluster**: Consider gene function, biological role, and tissue context. Write out your reasoning.

3. **Apply descriptive labels**:
   - Preferred: Functional description (e.g., "Proliferating cells", "Steroidogenic cells")
   - If uncertain: Description + marker (e.g., "Stromal-like (Col1a1+)")
   - **NEVER**: "Cluster X"

4. **Validation checks**:
   - All clusters have biological interpretation (no "Cluster X" labels)
   - Proportions are biologically plausible
   - Create summary table with counts and percentages
   - Generate dot plot of top markers
   - Create one violin plot per cell type, comparing its enriched markers to other cell types.
